I am working on AGPS download support for the Skytraq datalogger program.
Up-to-date satellite data speeds up the start-up of the device dramatically.
There is a Windows program "SkyTraq\_PC\_agps1.0.10.exe" that can be used to
transfer AGPS data to the datalogger. However, a pure Linux solution would of
cause be nicer.

The code for downloading the AGPS data and transmitting it to the device is
almost complete. I have solved all problems I had with timeout etc. The AGPS upload will be included into the normal release, soon.
