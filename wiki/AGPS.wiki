I am working on AGPS download support for the Skytraq datalogger program. 
Up-to-date satellite data speeds up the start-up of the device dramatically. 
There is a Windows program "SkyTraq_PC_agps1.0.10.exe" that can be used to 
transfer AGPS data to the datalogger. However, a pure Linux solution would of 
cause be nicer.

The code for downloading the AGPS data and transmitting it to the device is 
almost complete. Unfortunately the datalogger terminates the transmission 
after the second data block has been sent. I ran out of ideas what could be 
wrong.
