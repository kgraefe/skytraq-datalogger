I am working on AGPS download support for the Skytraq datalogger program. 
Up-to-date satellite data speeds up the start-up of the device dramatically. 
There is a Windows program "SkyTraq_PC_agps1.0.10.exe" that can be used to 
transfer AGPS data to the datalogger. However, a pure Linux solution would of 
cause be nicer.

The code for downloading the AGPS data and transmitting it to the device is 
almost complete. Unfortunately the datalogger terminates the transmission 
after the second data block has been sent. I ran out of ideas what could be 
wrong.

This happens when I send the block size to 128 bytes:
{{{
$ ./text
opened device with 9600 bit/s

got ACK
BINSIZE = 114638 Checksum = 216 Checksumb = 215
waiting for OK
read_string

data left: 114638
sending 128 bytes from position 0x80600f8
read_string
response from GPS device: OK
data left: 114510
sending 128 bytes from position 0x8060178

}}}
