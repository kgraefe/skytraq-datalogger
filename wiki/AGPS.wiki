I am working on AGPS download support for the Skytraq datalogger program. 
Up-to-date satellite data speeds up the start-up of the device dramatically. 
There is a Windows program "SkyTraq_PC_agps1.0.10.exe" that can be used to 
transfer AGPS data to the datalogger. However, a pure Linux solution would of 
cause be nicer.

The code for downloading the AGPS data and transmitting it to the device is 
almost complete. Ephemeris data is sent in block of 8192 bytes. The GPS device answers with "OK" after the transmission of each block. So far so good -- unfortunately the program runs into a timeout after sending the last block (that is typically smaller than 8192 bytes). However the Windows programs also seems to transmit no padding after the last block.

If you want to help with the development you can generate a test program by invoking
{{{
make test
}}}

The "test" program runs without further options and expects the GPS device to be attached to /dev/ttyUSB0.

This is the (abbreviated) output from the test program:
{{{
