#summary Documentation of the binary protocol used to store position data

There are two kind of entries, a long 18 byte entry and a short 8 byte entry. AN0008 describes when a long entry instead of the usual short entry is written. 

The first byte of a record determines the kind of entry.

The long entry contains this information: 
  * speed (km/h) 8 bit
  * number of week (GPS time) 12 bit
  * time of week (GPS time) 20 bit
  * [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECEF ECEF] x-axis 24 bit
  * ECEF y-axis 24 bit
  * ECEF z-axis 24 bit

A short entry contains the speed and differences to its preceding entry (short or long): 
  * speed (km/h) 8 bit
  * time difference 16 bit
  * ECEF x-axis difference
  * ECEF y-axis difference
  * ECEF z-axis difference
